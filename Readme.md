# PasswordChecker is Java group project for a class (Cyber Security Principles) 
#
# It accepts a string input from the user, checks if it respects all the password requirements. 
# If it does, then it tells the user how strong the password is and whatâ€™s the score given to the password. 
# If not valid, it will tell the user which requirements were not met. 
#
# I worked on the full code except for the GUI
